## I. Introduction

This document outlines common traditional tests used to detect strabismus.

## II. Tests

### A. Hirschberg Test 

* Involves shining a light into the patient's eyes and observing the reflection on the cornea. 
* The position of the reflection can indicate the presence and magnitude of strabismus. 
* The corneal light reflex is actually a reflection of Purkinje's image, which is a virtual image behind the pupil. 
* The Hirschberg test is limited in that it can only detect aesthetic strabismus. 
* There can be an apparent yaw (pseudostrabismus), where the pupillary axes are angled to each other but the visual axes are correctly positioned. 
* Conversely, there can also be strabismus that is masked by a Kappa angle of the opposite sign, giving the appearance of proper binocular position despite a yaw.

### B. Krimsky Test

*  A modification of the Hirschberg test.
*  Prisms are placed in front of the fixing eye with the apex pointing in the direction of the deviation. 
* This shifts the corneal reflex towards the centre of the pupil.
* The prism that centres the corneal reflex in both pupils indicates the angle of deviation. 
* The Krimsky test is typically used on children or adults who cannot cooperate, those with sensory strabismus, or those with vision worse than 20/400.

### C. Cover Test

* Involves covering one eye and observing the movement of the uncovered eye. 
* If the uncovered eye moves to fixate on a target, it indicates that the covered eye was not previously fixating on the target, signifying strabismus.
* The cover test is the reference standard for detecting strabismus.
* There are variations of the cover test, including:
    * The **Cover-Uncover Test** diagnoses manifest strabismus.
    * The **Alternate Cover Test** diagnoses latent strabismus.
    * The **Simultaneous Prism Cover Test** measures the magnitude of manifest and latent strabismus.
    * The **Prism Alternate Cover Test** measures the magnitude of both manifest and latent strabismus.

### D. Maddox Rod Test

* Uses lenses that refract a point of light into a line image in front of each eye. 
* The patient is asked to describe the orientation of the lines.

### E. Double Maddox Rod (DMR) Test

* The most common in-office test for the measurement of cyclodeviation.
* It is a subjective test.

### F. Synoptophore

* Projects two separate and dissimilar images into the same position in space to measure strabismus. 
* Synoptophores are difficult to use for non-specialists. They are not compact or easily transported and can only be used on cooperative patients.

### G. Lancaster Red-Green Test

* A subjective test for strabismus.

### H. Bruckner Test

* The Bruckner test is not mentioned as being commonly used to test for strabismus in any of the sources. 
* However, it is mentioned as being commonly used to detect amblyopia. 
* The Bruckner test involves illuminating both eyes simultaneously from a distance of about one metre and noting any difference in the brightness of the fundus reflex. 
* In the presence of strabismus, the reflex is darker in the fixing eye than in the deviated eye.

## III. Conclusion

This document provides a concise overview of traditional tests used to detect strabismus. It's important to note that the Bruckner test is primarily used for amblyopia detection, not strabismus.
