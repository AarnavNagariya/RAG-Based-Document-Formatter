      "The paper is well-structured, with a clear introduction that sets the context for the problem of quantum control. It provides a comprehensive background on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), curriculum learning, and quantum control before delving into the proposed Curriculum-Based DRL (CDRL) methodology. The sections are logically organized, progressing from theory to methodology, followed by numerical results and a discussion of the findings. The conclusion ties back to the initial research goals, summarizing the advantages of the CDRL approach over traditional methods like genetic algorithms and gradient methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction sets the stage well, providing context on the challenges of quantum control and highlighting the motivation for using DRL. It logically transitions into the need for curriculum learning to improve the efficiency of DRL in quantum systems. The paragraph structure is cohesive, making the background clear to the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.2 Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "This section introduces the framework of CDRL and is quite dense with technical details. It begins with an overview of curriculum learning in the context of quantum systems, followed by an explanation of how tasks are sequenced based on fidelity thresholds. The paragraphs transition logically, but the depth of the content might make it difficult for less familiar readers to grasp the methodology without rereading. More interpretation or simplification could have helped in understanding how the tasks are generated dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.3 Results\n",
      "\n",
      "The results section is well-organized. The authors provide detailed comparisons of CDRL with other methods using numerical simulations on both closed and open quantum systems. Each subsection begins with context about the problem being addressed, followed by an interpretation of the results. The authors successfully explain the figures, making it clear how to interpret the results, though more emphasis could be placed on connecting the results to the broader implications for quantum control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.4 Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion summarizes the main findings and emphasizes the advantages of the CDRL approach. It highlights the improvements in performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods. The conclusion effectively ties back to the initial research goals and provides a clear roadmap for future research directions.\n",

      "## 2. Organization within Sections\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction provides a compelling overview of the problem of quantum control and the limitations of traditional methods. The authors effectively convey the need for a new approach and introduce DRL as a potential solution. They then introduce curriculum learning as a key component of their proposed CDRL methodology. The introduction seamlessly connects the background information to the research problem and the proposed solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology section is technically dense and could benefit from further clarification for non-expert readers. The authors present a detailed description of the CDRL framework, but it could be more accessible with additional interpretive explanations. Breaking down the complex DRL algorithms, task generation, and reward structures into smaller, more manageable sections would improve comprehension. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.3 Results\n",
      "\n",
      "The results section effectively presents the numerical simulations and comparisons between CDRL and other methods. The authors clearly explain the experimental setups and interpret the results in a straightforward manner. They use figures and tables to visually illustrate the performance of different methods, making the results easily digestible. However, the section could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the implications of the findings for the field of quantum control.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Organization within Paragraphs\n",
      "\n",
      "The paragraphs generally follow a clear structure of context, content, and conclusions (CCC). For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In the Introduction, the authors start with the challenges of quantum control and proceed to explain why existing methods are insufficient, leading to the introduction of CDRL.\n",
      "* In the Results section, each simulation is introduced with an explanation of the setup, followed by the results and their interpretation. The authors successfully connect the results of different methods, such as CDRL and traditional DRL, but some paragraphs could have been broken down further to make the content easier to digest.\n",
      "\n",
      "One area where the paper could improve is in the Methodology section where the complexity of the DRL algorithms, task generation, and reward structures are presented in dense paragraphs. Breaking these down with more interpretive explanations could improve comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Quality of Figures\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.1 Resolution\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures are generally clear with adequate resolution, particularly the graphs comparing the performance of different algorithms (e.g., Fig. 4, Fig. 5). However, a few of the plots (such as Fig. 5) could benefit from a slightly larger font size to enhance readability, especially for readers looking at smaller screens.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Font Sizes\n",
      "\n",
      "The font sizes for axis labels and legends are legible but could be slightly larger for figures with dense information, such as those comparing fidelity and rewards across episodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.3 Color Choices\n",
      "\n",
      "The color choices are appropriate and sufficiently distinguish between different methods. For example, the use of different shades and line styles in Fig. 5 helps distinguish between CDRL, DRL-1, and DRL-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Lessons Learned from the Exercise\n",
      "\n",
      "This exercise highlighted the importance of clear transitions between sections and paragraphs, especially when dealing with complex topics such as deep reinforcement learning for quantum control. The authors did a good job of maintaining logical flow, but I was surprised by how dense some sections were, especially in the methodology. In future writing, I would focus on breaking down technical content into smaller, more digestible parts and ensuring that interpretations are presented immediately after introducing results. Additionally, I would pay more attention to figure readability by increasing font sizes and ensuring clear labeling. Overall, the exercise reinforced the importance of balancing technical depth with clarity.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Intro to Large Language Models\n",
      "\n",
      "A language model is a probabilistic model that assigns probabilities to sequences of words. \n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, a language model allows us to compute the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "P [ \"China\" | \"Shanghai is a city in\" ]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We usually train a neural network to predict these probabilities. A neural network trained on a large corpus of text is known as a Large Language Model (LLM). \n",
      "\n",
      "### RAG Pipeline\n",
      "\n",
      "The RAG pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Split into chunks:** The input document is split into smaller chunks.\n",
      "2. **Embeddings:** Each chunk is converted into an embedding vector using Sentence BERT.\n",
      "3. **Store:** The embedding vectors are stored in a vector database.\n",
      "4. **Search:** When a query is given, its embedding vector is calculated and used to search the vector database for the most similar chunks.\n",
      "5. **Top-K:** The top-K most similar chunks are retrieved from the vector database.\n",
      "6. **LLM:** The retrieved chunks are fed into a large language model (LLM) along with the query.\n",
      "7. **Prompt:** The LLM generates a response based on the query and the retrieved context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Embedding Vectors\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why do we use vectors to represent words?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the words \"cherry\", \"digital\" and \"information\", if we represent the embedding vectors using only 2 dimensions (X, Y) and we plot them, we hope to see something like this: the angle between words with similar meaning is small, while the angle between words with different meaning is big. So, the embeddings \"capture\" the meaning of the words they represent by projecting them into a high-dimensional space. \n",
      "\n",
      "We commonly use the cosine similarity, which is based on the dot product between the two vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Word embeddings: the ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "- Words that are synonyms tend to occur in the same context (surrounded by the same words). \n",
      "- For example, the word \"teacher\" and \"professor\" usually occur surrounded by the words \"school\", \"university\", \"exam\", \"lecture\", \"course\", etc..\n",
      "- The inverse can also be true: words that occur in the same context tend to have similar meanings. This is known as the **distributional hypothesis**.\n",
      "- This means that to capture the meaning of the word, we also need to have access to its context (the words surrounding it).\n",
      "- This is why we employ the Self-Attention mechanism in the Transformer model to capture contextual information for every token. The Self-Attention mechanism relates every token to all the other tokens in the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Word embeddings: the Cloze task\n",
      "\n",
      "- Imagine I give you the following sentence: \n",
      "  Rome is the _______  of Italy, which is why it hosts many government buildings. \n",
      "  Can you tell me what is the missing word?\n",
      "- Of course! The missing word is \"capital\", because by looking at the rest of the sentence, it is the one that makes the most sense.\n",
      "- This is how we train BERT: we want the Self-Attention mechanism to relate all the input tokens with each other, so that BERT has enough information about the \"context\" of the missing word to predict it.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### How do we train embedding vectors in BERT?\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Input  (14 tokens):  Output  (14 tokens):  Target  (1 token): capital\n",
      "Rome is the [mask]  of Italy, which is why it hosts many government buildings.\n",
      "TK1 TK2 TK3 TK4 TK5 TK6 TK7 TK8 TK9 TK10 TK11 TK12 TK13 TK14\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We run backpropagation to update the weights and minimize the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence Embeddings\n",
      "\n",
      "We can use the Self-Attention mechanism also to capture the \"meaning\" of an entire sentence. We can use a pre-trained BERT model to produce embeddings of entire sentences. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence Embeddings with BERT\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Input  (13 tokens):  Output  (13 tokens):\n",
      "Our professor always gives us lots of assignments to do in the weekend.\n",
      "TK1 TK2 TK3 TK4 TK5 TK6 TK7 TK8 TK9 TK10 TK11 TK12 TK13\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The output of the Self-Attention is a matrix of shape (13, 768). We can then apply mean-pooling to take the average of all the vectors, resulting in a single vector with 768 dimensions - our sentence embedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence Embeddings: comparison\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we compare Sentence Embeddings to see if two sentences have similar \"meaning\"? We could use the cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. A small angle results in a high cosine similarity score. \n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a problem: nobody told BERT that the embeddings it produces should be comparable with the cosine similarity, that is, two similar sentences should be represented by vectors pointing to the same direction in space. How can we teach BERT to produce embeddings that can be compared with a similarity function of our choice? \n",
      "\n",
      "### Introducing Sentence BERT\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence BERT is a variation of BERT that is specifically trained to produce sentence embeddings that are comparable using cosine similarity. It does this by using a Siamese network.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence BERT: architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence BERT uses two identical BERT models, one for each input sentence. The outputs of the BERT models are then fed into a pooling layer to produce sentence embeddings. The sentence embeddings are then compared using cosine similarity, and the loss is calculated based on the difference between the cosine similarity and the target similarity score.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Sentence A\n",

      "Cosine Similarity\n",
      "Target  (Cosine Similarity)\n",
      "Loss (MSE)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We can apply a linear layer to reduce the size of the embedding vector, for example from 768 to 512. We can use mean-pooling, max-pooling or just use the [cls] token as sentence embedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strategies to teach new concepts to LLM\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main strategies for teaching new concepts to an LLM:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fine-tuning:** The LLM is fine-tuned on a custom dataset that contains the desired knowledge. This can result in higher quality results compared to prompt engineering, but it can be expensive and may not be additive.\n",
      "2. **RAG:** The LLM is combined with a vector database that contains relevant context. This allows the LLM to access information from a wider range of sources, but it may not be as effective as fine-tuning for specific tasks.\n",
      "\n",

      "A vector database stores vectors of fixed dimensions (called embeddings) such that we can then query the database to find all the embeddings that are closest (most similar) to a given query vector using a distance metric, which is usually the cosine similarity, but we can also use the Euclidean distance. The database uses a variant of the KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) algorithm or another similarity search algorithm. Vector DBs are also used for finding similar songs (e.g. Spotify), images (e.g. Google Images) or products (e.g. Amazon).\n",

The participants, who were initially located in Nebraska and Kansas, were given a letter to be delivered to a specific person in Boston.

Instead, they were instructed to send it to someone they knew on a first-name basis, who they believed might have a better chance of knowing the target person.\n",

      "The purpose of this book is to describe the optical structure and optical properties of the human eye. It will be useful to those who have an interest in vision, such as optometrists, ophthalmologists, vision scientists, optical physicists, and students of visual optics. An understanding of the optics of the human eye is particularly important for designers of ophthalmic diagnostic equipment and visual optical systems, such as telescopes. \n",

      "Many animals have some sort of eye structure or sophisticated light sense. Like humans, some rely heavily on vision, including predatory birds and insects such as honeybees and dragonflies. However, many animals rely much more on other senses, particularly hearing and smell, than on vision. \n",

      "The visual sense is very complex and can process vast amounts of information very rapidly. How this is done is not fully understood; it requires greater knowledge of how the neural components of vision (retina, visual cortex, and other brain centers) process the retinal image. However, the first stage in this complex process is the formation of the retinal image. In this text, we investigate how the image is formed and discuss factors that affect its quality. \n",

      "Most animal eyes can be divided into two groups: compound eyes (as possessed by most insects) and vertebrate eyes (such as the human eye). Compared with vertebrate eyes, there is considerable variation in the compound eyes. Compound eyes contain many optical elements (ommatidia), each with its own aperture to the external world. Vertebrate eyes have a single aperture to the external world, which is used by all the detectors. Several other animals have simple eyes which can be described as developed versions of the vertebrate eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "All eyes, of whatever type, involve compromises between the need for detection (sensitivity), particularly at low light levels, and resolving capability in terms of the direction or form of an object. \n",

      "Although this book is about the optics of the human eye, we do not wish to consider the optics in complete isolation from the neural components. Otherwise, we cannot appreciate what influence changes in the retinal image will have on vision performance. As an example, altering the optics has considerable influence on the resolution of objects for central vision but not for peripheral vision. This is because the retina's neural structure is fine enough at its center but not in the periphery for large changes in optical quality to be of importance (Chapter 18). Thus, the neural components of the visual system, particularly the retinal detector, rate some mention in the book.\n",
