    "Report on Command-Line Interface (CLI) Shell Implementation in C\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "This C program implements a simple command-line interface (CLI) shell for Windows, similar to popular Unix/Linux shells such as Bash. The shell processes user input, manages command history, changes directories, lists files, and performs basic file system operations. The primary objective of this shell is to allow users to execute basic commands (cd, ls, pwd, echo, hist) and interact with the Windows operating system through a terminal interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Program Structure and Components\n",
    "2.1. Libraries and Macros\n",
    "The program includes several standard libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "<stdio.h>: Standard input/output functions.\n",
    "<stdlib.h>: Standard library functions like getenv() and strtok().\n",
    "<string.h>: Functions for string manipulation (strncpy(), strcmp()).\n",
    "<windows.h>: Windows-specific system calls (GetComputerName(), FindFirstFile()).\n",
    "<direct.h>: For directory-related functions like _getcwd() and _chdir().\n",
    "<limits.h>: For PATH_MAX (maximum allowable path length).\n",
    "Macros:\n",
    "\n",
    "MAX_INPUT: Defines the maximum size for input (1024 characters).\n",
    "MAX_ARGS: Sets the maximum number of command arguments (64).\n",
    "MAX_HISTORY: Sets the size of the command history buffer (10).\n",
    "2.2. Command History Management\n",
    "The program maintains a history of the last 10 commands executed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Variables:\n",
    "history[MAX_HISTORY][MAX_INPUT]: Stores the history of the last 10 commands.\n",
    "history_count: Tracks the current number of commands in the history.\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "add_to_history(const char *command): Adds the latest command to the history. If the history buffer is full, the oldest command is removed, and the new command is added.\n",
    "show_history(): Displays the command history to the user.\n",
    "2.3. Directory Navigation\n",
    "The program provides functionality to change and print the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "change_directory(char *path, char *prev_dir): Changes the current working directory. If no path is provided or the user specifies \"~\", it defaults to the user's home directory. If the user enters \"-\", the program switches to the previous directory.\n",
    "print_working_directory(): Prints the current working directory using _getcwd().\n",
    "2.4. File Listing\n",
    "list_files(): Lists the files in the current directory using Windows API functions. It leverages FindFirstFile() and FindNextFile() to traverse files and directories in the current location.\n",
    "2.5. Command Parsing and Execution\n",
    "The shell reads user input, tokenizes the command, and executes appropriate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell continuously waits for user input via fgets().\n",
    "The input is split into tokens using strtok(), and each token is stored in the args array.\n",
    "Commands are matched using strcmp() and executed based on a set of predefined commands.\n",
    "Supported Commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "cd: Changes the current directory. Handles special cases like cd - (switch to the previous directory) and cd ~ (switch to the home directory).\n",
    "ls: Lists files in the current directory.\n",
    "pwd: Prints the current working directory.\n",
    "echo: Prints the provided arguments to the terminal.\n",
    "hist: Displays the command history.\n",
    "exit: Exits the shell program.\n",
    "2.6. Command Execution Workflow\n",
    "Prompt Display: The shell prints a prompt in the format [username@hostname cwd]$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "username: Retrieved from the environment variable USERNAME.\n",
    "hostname: Obtained using the Windows function GetComputerName().\n",
    "cwd: The current working directory, fetched using _getcwd().\n",
    "Input Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell reads user input and processes it with fgets().\n",
    "If the command is not empty, it is added to the history using add_to_history().\n",
    "Command Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell tokenizes the input into commands and arguments.\n",
    "It checks for each supported command (cd, ls, pwd, echo, etc.) and invokes the corresponding function.\n",
    "If an unsupported command is entered, the shell prints an error message.\n",
    "Looping: The program continuously loops until the user types exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Error Handling\n",
    "The shell performs basic error handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "If getcwd() or chdir() fails, it prints an appropriate error message.\n",
    "If too many arguments are passed to the cd command, the program prints an error and ignores the command.\n",
    "The FindFirstFile() function handles cases where the directory cannot be read.\n",
    "4. Key Functions\n",
    "change_directory(char *path, char *prev_dir): Handles changing directories and supports navigating to the home directory (~) and switching to the previous directory (-).\n",
    "\n",
    "list_files(): Uses Windows API functions to list files and directories in the current location.\n",
    "\n",
    "echo_command(char *input): This function prints the user’s input to the terminal, implementing an echo command.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "This program demonstrates how a simple command-line shell can be implemented in C on a Windows system. It includes key features like command history, directory navigation, file listing, and the ability to execute basic commands. The use of Windows API functions enables interaction with the file system, while standard C functions handle input/output and string manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell could be further extended by adding support for more commands and features like piping, file redirection, or job control to make it more powerful.'''\n",

      "### Intro to Large Language Models\n",
      "\n",
      "A language model is a probabilistic model that assigns probabilities to sequences of words. \n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, a language model allows us to compute the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "P [ \"China\" | \"Shanghai is a city in\" ]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We usually train a neural network to predict these probabilities. A neural network trained on a large corpus of text is known as a Large Language Model (LLM). \n",
      "\n",
      "### RAG Pipeline\n",
      "\n",
      "The RAG pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Split into chunks:** The input document is split into smaller chunks.\n",
      "2. **Embeddings:** Each chunk is converted into an embedding vector using Sentence BERT.\n",
      "3. **Store:** The embedding vectors are stored in a vector database.\n",
      "4. **Search:** When a query is given, its embedding vector is calculated and used to search the vector database for the most similar chunks.\n",
      "5. **Top-K:** The top-K most similar chunks are retrieved from the vector database.\n",
      "6. **LLM:** The retrieved chunks are fed into a large language model (LLM) along with the query.\n",
      "7. **Prompt:** The LLM generates a response based on the query and the retrieved context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Embedding Vectors\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why do we use vectors to represent words?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the words \"cherry\", \"digital\" and \"information\", if we represent the embedding vectors using only 2 dimensions (X, Y) and we plot them, we hope to see something like this: the angle between words with similar meaning is small, while the angle between words with different meaning is big. So, the embeddings \"capture\" the meaning of the words they represent by projecting them into a high-dimensional space. \n",
      "\n",
      "We commonly use the cosine similarity, which is based on the dot product between the two vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Word embeddings: the ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "- Words that are synonyms tend to occur in the same context (surrounded by the same words). \n",
      "- For example, the word \"teacher\" and \"professor\" usually occur surrounded by the words \"school\", \"university\", \"exam\", \"lecture\", \"course\", etc..\n",
      "- The inverse can also be true: words that occur in the same context tend to have similar meanings. This is known as the **distributional hypothesis**.\n",
      "- This means that to capture the meaning of the word, we also need to have access to its context (the words surrounding it).\n",
      "- This is why we employ the Self-Attention mechanism in the Transformer model to capture contextual information for every token. The Self-Attention mechanism relates every token to all the other tokens in the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Word embeddings: the Cloze task\n",
      "\n",
      "- Imagine I give you the following sentence: \n",
      "  Rome is the _______  of Italy, which is why it hosts many government buildings. \n",
      "  Can you tell me what is the missing word?\n",
      "- Of course! The missing word is \"capital\", because by looking at the rest of the sentence, it is the one that makes the most sense.\n",
      "- This is how we train BERT: we want the Self-Attention mechanism to relate all the input tokens with each other, so that BERT has enough information about the \"context\" of the missing word to predict it.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### How do we train embedding vectors in BERT?\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Input  (14 tokens):  Output  (14 tokens):  Target  (1 token): capital\n",
      "Rome is the [mask]  of Italy, which is why it hosts many government buildings.\n",
      "TK1 TK2 TK3 TK4 TK5 TK6 TK7 TK8 TK9 TK10 TK11 TK12 TK13 TK14\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We run backpropagation to update the weights and minimize the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence Embeddings\n",
      "\n",
      "We can use the Self-Attention mechanism also to capture the \"meaning\" of an entire sentence. We can use a pre-trained BERT model to produce embeddings of entire sentences. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence Embeddings with BERT\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Input  (13 tokens):  Output  (13 tokens):\n",
      "Our professor always gives us lots of assignments to do in the weekend.\n",
      "TK1 TK2 TK3 TK4 TK5 TK6 TK7 TK8 TK9 TK10 TK11 TK12 TK13\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The output of the Self-Attention is a matrix of shape (13, 768). We can then apply mean-pooling to take the average of all the vectors, resulting in a single vector with 768 dimensions - our sentence embedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence Embeddings: comparison\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we compare Sentence Embeddings to see if two sentences have similar \"meaning\"? We could use the cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. A small angle results in a high cosine similarity score. \n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a problem: nobody told BERT that the embeddings it produces should be comparable with the cosine similarity, that is, two similar sentences should be represented by vectors pointing to the same direction in space. How can we teach BERT to produce embeddings that can be compared with a similarity function of our choice? \n",
      "\n",
      "### Introducing Sentence BERT\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence BERT is a variation of BERT that is specifically trained to produce sentence embeddings that are comparable using cosine similarity. It does this by using a Siamese network.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sentence BERT: architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence BERT uses two identical BERT models, one for each input sentence. The outputs of the BERT models are then fed into a pooling layer to produce sentence embeddings. The sentence embeddings are then compared using cosine similarity, and the loss is calculated based on the difference between the cosine similarity and the target similarity score.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Sentence A\n",
      "BERT\n",
      "Pooling\n",
      "Sentence Embedding A\n",
      "Sentence B\n",
      "BERT\n",
      "Pooling\n",
      "Sentence Embedding B\n",
      "Cosine Similarity\n",
      "Target  (Cosine Similarity)\n",
      "Loss (MSE)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We can apply a linear layer to reduce the size of the embedding vector, for example from 768 to 512. We can use mean-pooling, max-pooling or just use the [cls] token as sentence embedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strategies to teach new concepts to LLM\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main strategies for teaching new concepts to an LLM:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fine-tuning:** The LLM is fine-tuned on a custom dataset that contains the desired knowledge. This can result in higher quality results compared to prompt engineering, but it can be expensive and may not be additive.\n",
      "2. **RAG:** The LLM is combined with a vector database that contains relevant context. This allows the LLM to access information from a wider range of sources, but it may not be as effective as fine-tuning for specific tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Vector DB\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Vector DB: introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "A vector database stores vectors of fixed dimensions (called embeddings) such that we can then query the database to find all the embeddings that are closest (most similar) to a given query vector using a distance metric, which is usually the cosine similarity, but we can also use the Euclidean distance. The database uses a variant of the KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) algorithm or another similarity search algorithm. Vector DBs are also used for finding similar songs (e.g. Spotify), images (e.g. Google Images) or products (e.g. Amazon).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### K-NN: a naïve approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine we want to search for the query in our database: a simple way would be comparing the query with all the vectors, sorting them by distance, and keeping the top K.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are N embedding vectors and each has D dimensions, the computational complexity is in the order of O(N*D), too slow!🐌\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Similarity Search: let's trade precision for speed\n",
      "\n",
      "The naïve approach we used before, always produces accurate results, since it compares the query with all the stored vectors, but what if we reduced the number of comparison, but still obtain accurate results with high probability?\n",
      "\n",
      "The metric we usually care about in Similarity Search is recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this video we will explore an algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbors, called Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW). \n",
      "\n",
      "#### HNSW in the real world\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the same algorithm that powers Qdrant, the open source Vector DB used by Twitter’s (X) Grok LLM, which can access tweets in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### HNSW: idea #1\n",
      "\n",
      "HNSW is an evolution of the Navigable Small Worlds algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbors, which is based on the concept of **Six Degrees of Separation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milgram's experiment aimed to test the social connections among people in the United States. The participants, who were initially located in Nebraska and Kansas, were given a letter to be delivered to a specific person in Boston. However, they were not allowed to send the letter directly to the recipient. Instead, they were instructed to send it to someone they knew on a first-name basis, who they believed might have a better chance of knowing the target person.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of Milgram’s small-world experiment, Milgram found that most of the letters reached the final recipient in five or six steps, creating the concept that people all over the world are all connected by six degrees of separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook found in 2016 that its 1.59 billion active users were connected on average by 3.5 degrees of separation: https://research.facebook.com/blog/2016/02/three-and-a-half-degrees-of-separation/\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that you and Mark Zuckerberg are only 3.5 connections apart!\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Navigable Small Worlds\n",
      "\n",
      "The NSW algorithm builds a graph that – just like Facebook friends – connects close vectors with each other but keeping the total number of connections small. For example, every vector may be connected to up to 6 other vectors (to mimic the Six Degrees of Separation).\n",

      "\n",
      "The purpose of this book is to describe the optical structure and optical properties of the human eye. It will be useful to those who have an interest in vision, such as optometrists, ophthalmologists, vision scientists, optical physicists, and students of visual optics. An understanding of the optics of the human eye is particularly important for designers of ophthalmic diagnostic equipment and visual optical systems, such as telescopes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many animals have some sort of eye structure or sophisticated light sense. Like humans, some rely heavily on vision, including predatory birds and insects such as honeybees and dragonflies. However, many animals rely much more on other senses, particularly hearing and smell, than on vision. \n",
      "\n",
      "The visual sense is very complex and can process vast amounts of information very rapidly. How this is done is not fully understood; it requires greater knowledge of how the neural components of vision (retina, visual cortex, and other brain centers) process the retinal image. However, the first stage in this complex process is the formation of the retinal image. In this text, we investigate how the image is formed and discuss factors that affect its quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most animal eyes can be divided into two groups: compound eyes (as possessed by most insects) and vertebrate eyes (such as the human eye). Compared with vertebrate eyes, there is considerable variation in the compound eyes. Compound eyes contain many optical elements (ommatidia), each with its own aperture to the external world. Vertebrate eyes have a single aperture to the external world, which is used by all the detectors. Several other animals have simple eyes which can be described as developed versions of the vertebrate eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "All eyes, of whatever type, involve compromises between the need for detection (sensitivity), particularly at low light levels, and resolving capability in terms of the direction or form of an object. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although this book is about the optics of the human eye, we do not wish to consider the optics in complete isolation from the neural components. Otherwise, we cannot appreciate what influence changes in the retinal image will have on vision performance. As an example, altering the optics has considerable influence on the resolution of objects for central vision but not for peripheral vision. This is because the retina's neural structure is fine enough at its center but not in the periphery for large changes in optical quality to be of importance (Chapter 18). Thus, the neural components of the visual system, particularly the retinal detector, rate some mention in the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neural structures of the retina themselves produce optical effects. As an example, the photoreceptors exhibit waveguide properties that make light arriving from certain directions more efficient at stimulating vision than light arriving from other directions. Another example is that the regular arrangement of the nerve fiber layers produces polarization effects. \n",
      "\n",
      "While image formation in the eye is similar to that in man-made optical systems, such as cameras, and must obey the conventional optical laws, there are some interesting differences because of the eye's biological basis. Perhaps the greatest difference is that, as a living organ, the eye responds to its environment, often to give the best image under different circumstances. Also, it grows, suffers huge spatial optics, and has some ability to adapt.\n",
