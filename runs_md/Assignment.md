## "Tirich" by Uday Prakash: Analysis

Uday Prakash's story "Tirich" delves into a harrowing event involving the protagonist's father being bitten by a venomous lizard called Tirich, a creature steeped in Indian folklore. The father, a stoic figure commanding respect from his children, is known for his contemplative nature and silent demeanor. The story intertwines themes of fear, superstition, and survival, as the protagonist experiences both the real-world incident of his father's injury and the psychological terror stemming from his nightmares involving the Tirich.

### Harrowing Event

The father's encounter with the Tirich is vividly described, highlighting the gravity of the situation. In the rural setting of the story, a Tirich bite is considered fatal unless the creature is immediately killed.

The event unfolds against a backdrop of rural superstitions and fear, as traditional methods are used to attempt to extract the poison.

This contrast between the son's fear and the father's stoicism explores the different ways humans respond to the inevitability of death.

### Style
