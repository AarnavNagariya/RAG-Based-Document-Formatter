## Introduction

The purpose of this book is to describe the optical structure and optical properties of the human eye. It will be useful to those who have an interest in vision, such as optometrists, ophthalmologists, vision scientists, optical physicists, and students of visual optics. An understanding of the optics of the human eye is particularly important for designers of ophthalmic diagnostic equipment and visual optical systems, such as telescopes. 

Many animals have some sort of eye structure or sophisticated light sense. Like humans, some rely heavily on vision, including predatory birds and insects such as honeybees and dragonflies. However, many animals rely much more on other senses, particularly hearing and smell, than on vision. 

The visual sense is very complex and can process vast amounts of information very rapidly. How this is done is not fully understood; it requires greater knowledge of how the neural components of vision (retina, visual cortex, and other brain centers) process the retinal image. However, the first stage in this complex process is the formation of the retinal image. In this text, we investigate how the image is formed and discuss factors that affect its quality. 

Most animal eyes can be divided into two groups: compound eyes (as possessed by most insects) and vertebrate eyes (such as the human eye). Compared with vertebrate eyes, there is considerable variation in the compound eyes. Compound eyes contain many optical elements (ommatidia), each with its own aperture to the external world. Vertebrate eyes have a single aperture to the external world, which is used by all the detectors. Several other animals have simple eyes which can be described as developed versions of the vertebrate eye.

All eyes, of whatever type, involve compromises between the need for detection (sensitivity), particularly at low light levels, and resolving capability in terms of the direction or form of an object. 

Although this book is about the optics of the human eye, we do not wish to consider the optics in complete isolation from the neural components. Otherwise, we cannot appreciate what influence changes in the retinal image will have on vision performance. As an example, altering the optics has considerable influence on the resolution of objects for central vision but not for peripheral vision. This is because the retina's neural structure is fine enough at its center but not in the periphery for large changes in optical quality to be of importance (Chapter 18). Thus, the neural components of the visual system, particularly the retinal detector, rate some mention in the book.

The neural structures of the retina themselves produce optical effects. As an example, the photoreceptors exhibit waveguide properties that make light arriving from certain directions more efficient at stimulating vision than light arriving from other directions. Another example is that the regular arrangement of the nerve fiber layers produces polarization effects. 

While image formation in the eye is similar to that in man-made optical systems, such as cameras, and must obey the conventional optical laws, there are some interesting differences because of the eye's biological basis. Perhaps the greatest difference is that, as a living organ, the eye responds to its environment, often to give the best image under different circumstances. Also, it grows, suffers huge spatial optics, and has some ability to adapt.
