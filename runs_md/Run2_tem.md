## One Page Writeup

**Note:** The annotated pdf is trimmed as discussed with Vishnu sir as the paper was very long and it was difficult to annotate the whole paper in one go.

### 1. Overall Organization

The paper begins by providing details on the problem area of output interference in cued recall and the roles this forms in memory. The rationale of the study is presented at the end of the introduction and, although the goals are phrased quite generally, the study uses well-known memory models for instance SAM (Search of Associative Memory). The transition from context is also well structured in the paper and the subsequent sections of the paper which are methodology, results and discussion sections. It has to be pointed out that the authors provide a clear conclusion that connects to initial hypothesis and developed strong answer to the questions formulated at the beginning. In balance, the development of the paper progresses from one context to the next thus the conclusions and the process appears coherent from start to end. 

### 2. Organization within Sections

Each section begins with a brief but effective introduction that sets the stage for the content presented. For example, the Introduction clearly defines output interference and explains the need for a detailed investigation into cued recall, while the Methodology provides an adequate explanation of the models used, including their relevance to the research questions.

#### Introduction

This section closely proceeds from the general framework of the memory interference to the topic focus on cued recall. The paragraphs are linked coherently; the first one provides an introduction to Interference theories before moving to general information about SAM theory and retrieval filters. Relatedly, each of the paragraphs contributes to the subsequent one and results in coherent discussion.

#### Methodology

The models and parameters of the experiment are explained in detail as well as the simulations that have been done. However, the authors could also have given a little more transitions between the way the models, such as the SAM model, are described and why these specific parameters have been used in the simulation.

#### Results and Discussion

The results are good and well-organized, and for each experiment, the authors give a reasonable level of details as to the findings yielded by the experiment in question. Experimental results of each experiment are analyzed and differences, between Standard Model, and Learning-Only Model are described. Both the results of the experiment and its connection to the research questions are discussed adequately in the analysis. There is only one area that can be further enhanced and that is to express the consequences of every experiment right after the results have been demonstrated as opposed to the end of the test.

### 3. Organization within Paragraphs

The paragraphs mostly follow a clear structure of introducing the topic, providing content, and interpreting that content. However, there are a few places where clarity could be improved:

#### Introduction

Transition from the context to retrieval filters is abrupt and not well coordinated while explaining this aspect, the authors should have provided a link to focus on SAM and output interference. While the content is important the connection between the general theory put forward and the particular models employed could be made more central.

#### Methodology

Parameters values as presented in some of the paragraphs such as those explaining the results of the SAM simulations are at times presented in a somewhat fragmented manner. The authors could have been more effective connecting the explication of parameters to the possible outcomes, so as to enable the reader see reasons as to why some of these choices were made.

#### Results

This section is well structured in most part of the paper but for a better understanding of what the figures symbolized, there could be better integration of the explanation in the text especially in complicated papers such as that determining the function of the retrieval filter. Further, while the authors provide their explanations, they sometimes provide them in large textual chunks that should be better split to enhance cohesion.

### 4. Quality of Figures

The quality of figures is good overall, but there are some areas for improvement:

* **Resolution:** The resolution of the figures is clear, with no issues in distinguishing elements.
* **Font Sizes:** In some figures, such as the ones that plot response rates over test trials, the labels and axis titles are slightly small and could benefit from larger fonts to enhance readability.
* **Color Choices:** The color choices are clear and effectively distinguish between different types of responses (correct, intrusions, response failures). The use of different shapes (circles, squares, triangles) alongside the colors is helpful for readers to differentiate data points.

### 5. What I Learned from This Exercise

This exercise was good because it made me focus on how I organize and how I transition between ideas. The only issue which I had predicted to some extent was that the paper conformed to some extent to a logical flow, but what I did not know was how much of a difference can be made from paying attention to the transitions between the paragraphs and always making an authoritative interpretation as soon as possible after presenting the result. I also discovered that figures can be useful in presenting supporting results but noticed how it must always be readable due to font size and labels .
