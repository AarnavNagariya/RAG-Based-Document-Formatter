##  A Week in Words: From Scrabble to the Digital Age

### 1.  The Game of Scrabble

A week ago, a friend invited a couple of other couples over for dinner. Eventually, the food (but not the wine) was cleared off the table for what turned out to be some fierce Scrabbling. Heeding the strategy of going for the shorter, more valuable word over the longer cheaper word, our final play was “Bon,” which–as luck would have it!–happens to be a Japanese Buddhist festival, and not, as I had originally asserted while laying the tiles on the board, one half of a chocolate-covered cherry treat. Anyway, the strategy worked. My team only lost by 53 points instead of 58.

#### 1.1 The Strategy

The game highlighted a key strategy in Scrabble - prioritizing short, high-scoring words over longer, lower-scoring ones.  

#### 1.2 The Results

While our team didn't win, we managed to minimize our loss thanks to this strategy.  

### 2. The Challenge of Writing Short

Just the day before, our host had written of the challenges of writing short. In journalism–my friend’s chosen trade, and mostly my own, too–Mark Twain’s observation undoubtedly applies: “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”

#### 2.1 Mark Twain's Observation

Mark Twain's insightful observation about the difficulty of writing concisely resonates across various genres, from letters and journalism to other forms of writing.

#### 2.2 The Difficulty of Conciseness

Conciseness is a challenging skill to master. It's often easier to write at length than to pare down your ideas and express them succinctly.  

### 3. Long Sentences and the Overuse of Conjunctions 

Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen. This goes for concentrated writing as well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, in an ideal world, also demands concentration. But he never used email.) 

#### 3.1 The Problem of Lengthy Sentences 

In the digital age, there's a tendency to write long, rambling sentences, even in casual correspondence. 

#### 3.2 The Impact of Conjunctions

I recently caught myself cramming four conjunctions into a three-line sentence in an email. This overuse of conjunctions can create a cluttered and convoluted sentence structure. 

#### 3.3 Hemingway vs. Faulkner

It's better to strive for a concise, declarative style that reads like Hemingway than a rambling, convoluted style reminiscent of Faulkner.

### 4.  The Role of Style and Length

Length–as we all know, and for lack of a more original or effective way of saying it–matters. But (ahem), it’s also a matter of how you use it. Style and length are technically two different things.

#### 4.1 The Interplay of Style and Length 

While length is certainly important, it's equally important to consider how you employ it. Style and length are intertwined aspects of writing.

#### 4.2 The Impact of Time Constraints

The digital age has fostered a culture of instant communication and brevity, which can have a significant impact on writing style and length. 

### 5.  The Nature of Digital Communication

Try putting some prose onscreen, though, and they mix themselves up pretty quickly. This has much to do with the time constraints we claim to feel in the digital age. We don’t have time to compose letters and post them anymore–much less pay postage, what with all the banks kinda-sorta losing our money these days–so we blast a few emails. We don’t have time to talk, so we text. We don’t have time to text to specific people, so we update our Facebook status. We don’t have time to write essays, so we blog.

#### 5.1  The Superficial Reduction of Words 

I'm less interested in the superficial reduction of words – like "imho" or "cu l8r" – than in the genres that have emerged to accommodate these abbreviated communications: blogs, texts, tweets, and emails.

#### 5.2 The Emergence of New Genres

The digital age has spawned new genres of writing, each with its own conventions and characteristics.

#### 5.3 The Limits of Brevity 

Do these interstitial communiques truly reflect super brevity that would make Twain proud? Or do they simply represent poorly stylized writing seeking a clearer form?

#### 5.4 Clive Thompson's Observation

Clive Thompson, writing in the New York Times Magazine, observed that constant digital updates, after a day, can begin "to feel like a short story; follow it for a month, and it’s a novel." He correctly recognized the bits as part of a larger whole.

#### 5.5 The Lack of Conventional Length

While our digital communications may resemble elements of traditional genres like stories and novels, they lack the defined conclusions and conventional lengths of those forms. How long is the conventional blog, when you add up all of its posts and comments? How long is the longest email thread you send back and forth on a single topic?
